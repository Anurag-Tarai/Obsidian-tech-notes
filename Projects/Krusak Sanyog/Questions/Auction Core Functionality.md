### **1. Auction System**

1. **How does the auction system work end-to-end for farmers and buyers?**
    
    - Farmers create a auction for their products by providing details like type, quality, quantity, and start price. Buyers bid in real-time during the auction period. The highest bidder wins when the auction ends, and the system notifies both parties for payment and logistics.
2. **What is the minimum duration for an auction, and can it be extended dynamically?**
    
    - The minimum duration can be set to 1 hours. Extensions can be triggered dynamically if there is active bidding near the end, ensuring fair competition.
3. **How are bids validated to ensure they are genuine?**
    - **Bidders are verified during registration through KYC (Know Your Customer)**, which includes Aadhaar card, PAN card, or Voter ID verification to ensure authenticity. Payments are pre-authorized via UPI, net banking, or linked wallets to confirm bidders have sufficient funds before they place bids. This ensures only genuine bidders participate in the auction process.

4. **What happens if no buyer places a bid within the auction duration?**
    
    -  **Instant Direct Sale**: The platform offers the product to nearby buyers at the reserve price or a slightly discounted price for quick sale.

	- **Donation Option**: The farmer can opt to donate unsold products to local NGOs, community kitchens, or food banks to avoid waste and benefit the community.
1. **Can a farmer set a "Buy Now" price alongside the auction?**
    
    - Yes, a "Buy Now" price option allows buyers to purchase immediately without waiting for the auction to end.
6. **How will farmers be notified of new bids or when the auction ends?**
    
    - Farmers receive notifications via SMS, push notifications, or email. Offline farmers can be notified via call if required.
7. **What measures are in place to prevent bid manipulation or fraud?**
    
    - Only verified accounts can bid. The platform monitors bidding patterns to detect irregularities like fake or repetitive bids.
