**KYC (Know Your Customer)** is a process used by businesses, especially financial institutions, to verify the identity of their customers. This process helps ensure that services are not misused for illegal activities like fraud, money laundering, or terrorist financing.

In India, KYC typically involves the following steps:

1. **Document Verification**: Customers need to provide official documents, such as:
    
    - Aadhaar card
    - PAN card
    - Voter ID
    - Passport, etc.
2. **Photo and Biometric Verification**: Some institutions may require a photograph or biometric details (like fingerprints or facial recognition) for more secure identification.
    
3. **Address Proof**: Customers may need to submit documents that confirm their address, such as utility bills or rental agreements.
    

In the context of your project, **KYC** ensures that buyers and sellers (farmers) are verified, authentic individuals and reduces the risk of fraudulent transactions.
