### Final Auction System Flow:

#### **Farmer Side**:

1. **Create Auction**: Farmer lists the product with a starting price, start time, and optional reserve price.
2. **Auction Monitoring**: Monitor real-time bids, view notifications, and cancel the auction if no bids are placed.
3. **Auction Ends**: Highest bid wins; product is sold if reserve price is met.

#### **Retailer Side**:

1. **Browse Auctions**: Retailers view and filter auctions, place bids, and receive notifications when outbid.
2. **Auction Ends**: Winning bid generates an order. Payment via escrow and product delivery begins.

#### **System Enhancements**:

- **Verification with Govt ID** ensures legitimate users.
- **Escrow** protects the transaction.
- **AI-powered pricing** helps farmers set competitive prices.
- **Bidding history and analytics** provide transparency and insights.
