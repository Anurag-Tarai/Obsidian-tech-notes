Your **Spring Boot backend** already handles the core logic, data processing, and database interactions. For your **mobile app**, you only need to focus on:

### **Frontend Development for the Mobile App**

1. **Building the User Interface (UI)**:
    
    - Create screens for login, product listings, auctions, chats, etc.
2. **Connecting the Mobile Frontend to Your Spring Boot APIs**:
    
    - Use HTTP requests to interact with your backend's REST APIs.
    - Handle authentication (e.g., JWT) and error responses.
3. **Implementing Features**:
    
    - Fetch and display data from the backend.
    - Send user inputs (e.g., form submissions, chat messages) to your APIs.
    - Handle real-time updates (e.g., WebSocket for chats, auctions).

### **How It Works**:

1. **Spring Boot APIs**:
    
    - Your backend serves data and processes user requests via APIs (e.g., `/products`, `/login`, `/chat`).
2. **Mobile Frontend**:
    
    - The app makes HTTP requests to these APIs.
    - Example flow:
        - User logs in via the mobile app.
        - App sends credentials to `/login` API.
        - Backend validates and returns a JWT token.
        - App uses the token for future API calls like `/products`.

### **Benefits**:

- **Reuse Backend Logic**: No need to duplicate business logic. Use the same APIs across mobile, web, and other platforms.
- **Focus on UI/UX**: Spend time crafting a great user experience on mobile.
- **Scalability**: Add more frontend clients (e.g., web app, admin portal) without changes to the backend.
