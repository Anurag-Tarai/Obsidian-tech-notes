To verify a **user's identity** in the context of a database system using **Aadhar** and **PAN**, hereâ€™s how these fields are typically utilized:

### 1. **Aadhar (Unique ID for Indian Citizens)**

- **Purpose:** Verify identity and address proof.
- **Validation Process:**
    - **Format Check:** Aadhar numbers have 12 digits. Use regex to validate the format: `^\d{12}$`.
    - **Authentication:** Use an API like UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India) for online authentication.
    - **Address Match:** Compare the address in the system with the Aadhar-linked address for further verification.

### 2. **PAN (Permanent Account Number)**

- **Purpose:** Verify tax-related information.
- **Validation Process:**
    - **Format Check:** PAN has a fixed format (5 letters + 4 digits + 1 letter). Validate with regex: `[A-Z]{5}\d{4}[A-Z]`.
    - **Authentication:** Cross-check PAN with government records using APIs provided by the Income Tax Department of India.
    - **Name Match:** Verify that the name linked with the PAN matches the user's provided name.

### Combined Verification

1. **Aadhar and PAN Validation:**
    
    - Ensure both the Aadhar and PAN are valid using their respective validation mechanisms.
    - Cross-check if the details (like name, date of birth) from Aadhar and PAN match.
2. **Flag Suspicious Users:**
    
    - If Aadhar or PAN details are inconsistent or invalid, flag the user for manual review.
3. **Verification Status in Database:**
    
    - Maintain a field like `is_verified` in the **User** table to store the result of the verification process (e.g., `true` for verified users).

### Example Workflow in Code:

1. Collect user input (Aadhar, PAN, and personal details).
2. Validate the format of both Aadhar and PAN.
3. Call the respective APIs for verification.
4. Update the `is_verified` field in the database.

### SQL Schema Update for Verification:

sql

Copy code

`ALTER TABLE User ADD COLUMN is_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;`
