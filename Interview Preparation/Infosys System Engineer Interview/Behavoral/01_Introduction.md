## Greeting
Good morning/afternoon, sir/mam!

## Response to "Tell about yourself
Thank you, sir, for giving me this opportunity. My name is Anurag Tarai, and I am from Baluagon, Khordha. I am currently in my final year of MCA at Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology, and my current CGPA is 7.5. I have scored 73.17% in both 10th and 12th grades, and my bachelor's CGPA was 7.85.

During my MCA, I have focused on Java and have worked on some hands-on projects to gain practical experience.

- My first project is a **Project Management System** where users can create projects, invite others to join, and manage tasks. Team members can update task statuses to "To Do", "In Progress", or "Done". I also implemented a group chat for communication between members. For the backend, I used Spring Boot, spring security with JWT for  authentication, Spring Starter Mail for sending invitations, and MySQL as the database. The frontend was developed using React, Tailwind, and ShadCN UI.
    
- My second project is a **Journal App** focused on managing journal entries. I developed APIs for handling journal entries and used Spring Security for basic authentication, with MongoDB as the primary data storage. I also implemented role-based access control in the app. For testing and development, I used Postman.
    

I worked on these projects to gain hands-on experience with different technologies before joining a development team.
