### **General Server Questions**

1. **What are the main types of servers apart from web servers and database servers?**
    
    - File servers, mail servers, application servers, DNS servers, FTP servers, and proxy servers.
2. **How does a server handle multiple client requests at the same time?**
    
    - Servers handle multiple client requests using multithreading, which allows each request to be processed concurrently, improving efficiency.
3. **What is the difference between a client and a server in a network?**
    
    - A **client** sends requests for data or services (e.g., a web browser), while a **server** processes those requests and provides responses (e.g., a web server delivering web pages).
4. **Can a single machine act as multiple types of servers? If yes, how?**
    
    - Yes, a single machine can act as multiple servers (e.g., web server, database server) using different software or virtualization to handle different types of requests.
5. **What is a virtual server, and how is it different from a physical server?**
    
    - A **virtual server** is a server created using software on a real, physical computer. It acts like a separate server but shares the resources (like CPU and memory) of the physical computer.

	- A **physical server** is a real, physical machine that runs directly on hardware without relying on software for virtualization.

In short, a virtual server is a software-based server running on a physical machine.

### **Web Server Questions**

6. **How does a web server handle HTTP requests and responses?**
    
    - A web server listens for HTTP requests, processes them (usually by fetching files or generating dynamic content), and sends back HTTP responses (e.g., HTML files, JSON data).
7. **What are static and dynamic content? How does a web server serve them?**
    
    - **Static content**: Fixed files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JS) served as-is.
    - **Dynamic content**: Generated on-the-fly (e.g., using PHP, Node.js) based on user input or other conditions.
8. **What is the role of a web server in hosting a React application?**
    
    - A web server serves the compiled React application (static files like HTML, CSS, and JS) to usersâ€™ browsers.
9. **What is the difference between a web server and an application server?**
    
    - A **web server** serves static content and handles HTTP requests, while an **application server** processes business logic and often interacts with databases or other services.
10. **How do web servers handle SSL/TLS for secure communication?**
    

- Web servers use **SSL/TLS** certificates to encrypt communication between the server and client, ensuring data security over HTTP (forming **HTTPS**).

### **Database Server Questions**

11. **How does a database server interact with a backend server?**

- The backend server sends SQL queries to the database server to retrieve, insert, or update data, and the database server responds with the requested data or status.

12. **What is the difference between a database server and a file server?**

- A **database server** manages structured data in a database, while a **file server** stores and shares files without structured querying capabilities.

13. **What is the role of SQL in a database server?**

- SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to query, update, and manage the data in a relational database on the database server.

14. **How does a database server ensure data consistency and integrity?**

- Database servers use **ACID** properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to ensure data is processed reliably and consistently.

15. **What is the difference between relational and non-relational database servers?**

- **Relational** databases store data in tables with predefined schemas (e.g., MySQL), while **non-relational** databases store unstructured data in flexible formats (e.g., MongoDB).

### **Web Server vs. Backend Server Questions**

16. **Can a web server and a backend server run on the same machine?**

- Yes, both can run on the same machine, with the web server handling static content and the backend server handling business logic.

17. **Why is it better to separate a web server and a backend server in large-scale applications?**

- Separating them improves scalability, load balancing, and maintainability, allowing each server to be optimized for specific tasks.

18. **What happens if a web server receives a request for dynamic content but no backend server is configured?**

- If no backend server is configured, the web server cannot process dynamic requests and will return an error or serve static content instead.

19. **How does load balancing work between web servers and backend servers?**

- Load balancing distributes incoming requests between multiple web servers or backend servers, ensuring even resource usage and preventing overload.

20. **What is an API server, and how does it relate to a backend server?**

- An **API server** is a type of backend server that exposes APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to allow communication between different systems or services.
