#### What is a Server ?
A server is a computer or software program that provides services or resources to other devices (clients) over a network. 

#### What is a web Server ?
A web server is a type of server that delivers web content to clients (usually browsers) over the internet or an intranet. It serves HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, and other resources when a user requests a website.

**Examples:** Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, IIS.

#### What is a Database Server ?
A **database server** is a server dedicated to managing and storing data in databases. It processes requests from backend systems to retrieve, insert, update, or delete data. 

**Examples:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database

#### 9. What is the difference between a web server and an application server?
    
- A **web server** serves static content and handles HTTP requests, while an **application server** processes business logic and often interacts with databases or other services.

#### What is a `virtual server `?
- A **virtual server** is a server created using software on a real, physical computer. It acts like a separate server but shares the resources (like CPU and memory) of the physical computer.

- A **physical server** is a real, physical machine that runs directly on hardware without relying on software for virtualization.

Example
- **Physical Server**: Your laptop when it's used to host server software.
- **Virtual Server**: A server running in a virtual environment, such as on cloud platforms or in virtual machine software like VirtualBox.

#### Apache Tomcat Vs Nginx
- **Apache Tomcat**: Can serve both static and dynamic content (acts as both web and application server).
- **Nginx**: Primarily a web server that serves static content and works as a reverse proxy but does not process dynamic application logic.
#### Load balancing
**Load balancing** is the process of distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to optimize resource use, improve response time, and ensure reliability.

- **How it works**: A load balancer distributes client requests to servers based on factors like availability and current load.
- **Types**:
    - **Round Robin**: Distributes requests evenly across all servers.
    - **Least Connections**: Sends requests to the server with the fewest active connections.
    - **IP Hashing**: Routes requests from the same IP address to the same server.

**Example of Load Balancers**:

- **Hardware Load Balancers**: F5 BIG-IP, Cisco, Citrix NetScaler.
- **Software Load Balancers**: Nginx, HAProxy, AWS Elastic Load Balancing.

#### Different types of servers 
Here is a list of different types of servers:

1. **Web Server** – Serves web pages to users' browsers. Example: Apache, Nginx.
2. **Database Server** – Manages and provides database services to other applications or users. Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL.
3. **File Server** – Provides centralized file storage for access and sharing. Example: FTP server, Samba.
4. **Mail Server** – Manages and stores email data. Example: Microsoft Exchange, Postfix.
5. **Application Server** – Hosts and runs applications, providing business logic to client applications. Example: Tomcat, WebLogic.
6. **DNS Server** – Resolves domain names to IP addresses. Example: BIND, Microsoft DNS.
7. **Proxy Server** – Acts as an intermediary for requests from clients to servers, often used for security or caching. Example: Squid, HAProxy.
8. **FTP Server** – Transfers files using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). Example: vsftpd, FileZilla.
9. **DHCP Server** – Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices in a network. Example: ISC DHCP Server.
10. **Game Server** – Hosts multiplayer online games. Example: Minecraft server, Counter-Strike server.
11. **Print Server** – Manages print requests from multiple devices. Example: CUPS (Common Unix Printing System).
12. **Backup Server** – Stores backup copies of data for recovery. Example: Bacula, Acronis.
13. **Media Server** – Streams audio, video, or other media content. Example: Plex, Jellyfin.
14. **Virtual Server** – A server running within a virtualized environment, such as on VMware or Hyper-V.
15. **Cloud Server** – A virtual server hosted on cloud infrastructure. Example: AWS EC2, Azure Virtual Machines.
16. **Authentication Server** – Manages user authentication and access control. Example: LDAP, RADIUS.
17. **Directory Server** – Stores and manages directory information, often for services like LDAP. Example: OpenLDAP, Microsoft Active Directory.
18. **Chat Server** – Hosts real-time messaging applications. Example: XMPP server, IRC server
