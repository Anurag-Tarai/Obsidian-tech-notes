26. What is the difference between `DISTINCT` and `GROUP BY`?
#### `GROUP BY` Clause in SQL (Short Note)

The `GROUP BY` clause groups rows with the same values in specified columns into summary rows. It is often used with aggregate functions (`COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc.) to perform calculations on each group.

#### **Key Points**:

- **Purpose**: Group rows based on common column values.
- **Usage**: Commonly used with aggregate functions to summarize data.
- **Example**:
```sql
SELECT department, SUM(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department;

# Syntax
SELECT column1, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1;

```
    
- **Multiple Columns**: You can group by more than one column.
- **Filter Groups**: Use `HAVING` to filter the grouped results.

#### **`DISTINCT`**:
Eliminates duplicate rows from the result set, returning only unique values.

- Example:
    
    `SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;`


### 27. Explain the difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses.

- **`WHERE`**: Filters rows **before grouping**; does not use aggregate functions.  
- Filters individual rows.
    Example:
    
    `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;`
    
- **`HAVING`**: Filters groups **after grouping**; can use aggregate functions.  
    Example:
    
    `SELECT department, SUM(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department HAVING SUM(salary) > 100000;`

### **30. Explain the use of aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()`.**

- **`COUNT()`**: Counts the number of rows.
    `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;`
    
- **`SUM()`**: Adds values in a column.
    `SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees;`
    
- **`AVG()`**: Calculates the average of values in a column.
    `SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;`
    
- **`MIN()`**: Finds the smallest value in a column.
    `SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employees;`
    
- **`MAX()`**: Finds the largest value in a column.
    `SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees;`
