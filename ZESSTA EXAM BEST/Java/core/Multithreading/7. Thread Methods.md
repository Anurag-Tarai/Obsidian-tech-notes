### **1. `start()`**

- **Purpose**: Begins the execution of the thread. It invokes the `run()` method in a new call stack.
- **Usage**: `Thread t = new Thread(); t.start();`
- **Note**: A thread can only be started once; invoking `start()` on a thread that has already been started will throw an `IllegalThreadStateException`.

---

### **2. `run()`**

- **Purpose**: Contains the code that constitutes the new thread’s task. You override this method in your custom thread class.
- **Usage**:
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `public void run() {     // Code to be executed by the thread }`
    
- **Note**: This method is automatically called when the thread starts.

---

### **3. `sleep(long millis)`**

- **Purpose**: Causes the currently executing thread to pause for the specified number of milliseconds (ms). The thread remains in the **sleeping** state during this time.
- **Usage**: `Thread.sleep(1000);` // Sleeps for 1 second
- **Note**: Throws `InterruptedException` if another thread interrupts it while sleeping.

---

### **4. `join()`**

- **Purpose**: Causes the current thread to wait until the thread on which `join()` was called has finished executing.
- **Usage**: `thread.join();`
- **Note**: Can take a time argument: `thread.join(1000);` // Waits up to 1 second.

---

### **5. `interrupt()`**

- **Purpose**: Interrupts the thread. If the thread is in a blocking state (e.g., `sleep()` or `wait()`), it will throw an `InterruptedException`.
- **Usage**: `thread.interrupt();`
- **Note**: Does not forcibly stop the thread but sets the interrupt flag.

---

### **6. `isAlive()`**

- **Purpose**: Checks if the thread has been started and has not yet finished executing.
- **Usage**: `boolean isAlive = thread.isAlive();`
- **Note**: Returns `true` if the thread is still alive.

---

### **7. `setPriority(int priority)`**

- **Purpose**: Sets the priority of the thread. The priority should be between `Thread.MIN_PRIORITY` (1) and `Thread.MAX_PRIORITY` (10). Default priority is `Thread.NORM_PRIORITY` (5).
- **Usage**: `thread.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);`
- **Note**: It influences the OS's thread scheduler but doesn't guarantee execution order.

---

### **8. `getName()`**

- **Purpose**: Returns the name of the thread.
- **Usage**: `String threadName = thread.getName();`
- **Note**: Default name is `"Thread-0"`, `"Thread-1"`, etc., if not explicitly set.

---

### **9. `setName(String name)`**

- **Purpose**: Sets a custom name for the thread.
- **Usage**: `thread.setName("WorkerThread");`

---

### **10. `getId()`**

- **Purpose**: Returns the unique ID of the thread.
- **Usage**: `long threadId = thread.getId();`

---

### **11. `yield()`**

- **Purpose**: Hints to the thread scheduler that the current thread is willing to yield its current use of the CPU to other threads of the same or higher priority.
- **Usage**: `Thread.yield();`
- **Note**: It doesn’t guarantee that another thread will execute immediately.

---

### **12. `currentThread()`**

- **Purpose**: Returns a reference to the currently executing thread.
- **Usage**: `Thread current = Thread.currentThread();`

---

### **13. `setDaemon(boolean on)`**

- **Purpose**: Marks the thread as a **daemon thread**. A daemon thread is a background thread that doesn’t prevent the program from exiting.
- **Usage**: `thread.setDaemon(true);`
- **Note**: A daemon thread is terminated automatically when all user threads are finished.

---

### **14. `getState()`**

- **Purpose**: Returns the state of the thread (e.g., NEW, RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, WAITING, TIMED_WAITING, TERMINATED).
- **Usage**: `Thread.State state = thread.getState();`

---

### **15. `stop()` (Deprecated)**

- **Purpose**: Stops the thread immediately, but it's **deprecated** because it is unsafe and can cause inconsistent states in applications.
- **Usage**: `thread.stop();`
- **Note**: Avoid using `stop()`. Use `interrupt()` to safely terminate threads.

---

### **Thread Lifecycle States**

- **NEW**: Thread is created but not yet started.
- **RUNNABLE**: Thread is ready to run and waiting for the CPU.
- **BLOCKED**: Thread is blocked while waiting for a resource.
- **WAITING**: Thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a specific action.
- **TIMED_WAITING**: Thread is waiting for a specified amount of time.
- **TERMINATED**: Thread has finished execution.
