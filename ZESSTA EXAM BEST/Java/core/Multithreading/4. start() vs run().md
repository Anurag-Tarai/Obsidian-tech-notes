- **`start()`**: Begins the threadâ€™s execution, internally calling the **`run()`** method in a new thread.
- **`run()`**: Contains the logic to be executed by the thread once it starts, but should not be called directly. 
- When you call the `run()` method directly in a Java thread, the code inside the `run()` method will execute like a normal method call, **without creating a new thread**. This means **no concurrency**.
