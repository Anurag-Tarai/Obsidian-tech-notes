Hi, this is Anurag Tarai! I'm sharing my thought of the day. Today, I woke up at 9 p.m. because I slept at 4 a.m. I know it's pretty late, but I usually sleep around 10 p.m. I'm working on my project for placement, and I encountered some errors. I fixed all of them, and after finishing my work, I finally went to sleep. It's really fun solving real-life problems through programming; errors are painful, but solving them brings a great feeling. I’m starting to understand what life means—it’s all about hustling and struggling. Working hard is the best thing you can do. My advice is to never doubt yourself because it's meaningless. Doubting only makes things worse, and no matter what, remind yourself that you’re the best. That will boost your confidence, which is the key to solving problems in this world.
