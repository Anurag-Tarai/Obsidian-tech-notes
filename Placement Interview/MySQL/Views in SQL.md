An **SQL View** is a virtual table that is created by a query. It doesn't store data itself but displays data from one or more tables. 
### Key Points:

- **Virtual Table:** No physical storage; just a query result.
- **Simplification:** Makes complex queries reusable.
- **Security:** Can limit access to specific columns or rows.
- **Updatable:** In some cases, views allow data modifications (inserts, updates, deletes).

### Use Cases:

- **Simplifying Complex Queries:** Create views to simplify frequently used, complex joins or filters.
- **Data Abstraction:** Hide details of table structure from users.
- **Security and Access Control:** Provide limited data access (e.g., specific columns) to certain users.

```sql
CREATE VIEW active_customers AS
SELECT name, email FROM customers WHERE status = 'active';
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM active_customers;
```
