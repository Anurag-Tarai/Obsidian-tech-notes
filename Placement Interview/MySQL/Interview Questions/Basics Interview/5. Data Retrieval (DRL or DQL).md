**24. What is the difference between `BETWEEN` and `IN` clauses?**

- **`BETWEEN`**: Used to filter values within a specified range (inclusive). Example:
    
    `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age BETWEEN 25 AND 40;`
    
- **`IN`**: Used to filter values that match any value in a list. Example:
    
    `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department IN ('HR', 'IT');`
