1. **What is SQL, and what are its primary uses?**
    
    - SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to interact with databases.
    - **Primary uses:** Data retrieval, insertion, updating, deletion, and database management.
2. **Define RDBMS. How does it differ from DBMS?**
    
    - **RDBMS (Relational Database Management System):** A database management system that stores data in tables (rows and columns) and maintains relationships between tables.
    - **Difference:**
        - **RDBMS:** Uses tables with relationships; follows normalization; supports ACID properties.
        - **DBMS:** Stores data as files; does not support relationships or ACID properties strictly.
3. **Explain the CRUD operations in SQL.**
    
    - **C**reate: Insert new data into the database (`INSERT`).
    - **R**ead: Retrieve data (`SELECT`).
    - **U**pdate: Modify existing data (`UPDATE`).
    - **D**elete: Remove data (`DELETE`).
4. **What is the difference between SQL and MySQL?**
    
    - **SQL:** A language for database operations.
    - **MySQL:** A database management system that uses SQL for performing operations.
5. **How is data stored in an RDBMS?**
    
    - Data is stored in **tables** consisting of rows (records) and columns (attributes). Each table has a unique name, and relationships between tables are defined using **keys** (primary, foreign, etc.).
