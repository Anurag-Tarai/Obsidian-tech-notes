- ###### **13. What is the difference between `TRUNCATE`, `DELETE`, and `DROP` commands in SQL?**

1. **TRUNCATE**:
    
    - Removes all rows from a table, but the table's structure and schema remain intact.
2. **DELETE**:
    
    - Removes specific rows based on a `WHERE` condition. If no condition is provided, all rows can be deleted.
3. **DROP**:
    
    - Deletes the entire table (or database), including its structure and schema.
    - Irreversible and permanently removes the object.
**Example:**

- `TRUNCATE TABLE customers;` – Deletes all data but keeps the `customers` table.
- `DELETE FROM customers WHERE id = 1;` – Deletes the row where `id = 1`.
- `DROP TABLE customers;` – Deletes the `customers` table entirely.

## Log is context of Database
**Transaction Log in Databases:**

- A database maintains a **transaction log** to record changes (like insertions, updates, or deletions) for recovery and rollback purposes.

14. **What is the purpose of DCL commands like `GRANT` and `REVOKE`?**

- **`GRANT`:** Assigns specific privileges to users.
    `GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON students TO user1;`
    
- **`REVOKE`:** Removes previously granted privileges from users.
    `REVOKE INSERT ON students FROM user1;`
    

15. **What is the difference between `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK` in TCL?**

- **`COMMIT`:** Permanently saves all changes made during the transaction.
    
```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE students SET age = 20 WHERE id = 1;
COMMIT;
```
    
- **`ROLLBACK`:** Reverts changes made during the transaction, restoring the database to its previous state.
    
```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE students SET age = 20 WHERE id = 1;
ROLLBACK;
```
    

**Key Difference:** `COMMIT` confirms changes; `ROLLBACK` undoes them.
- **`COMMIT`**:
    
    - Saves all changes made during the transaction permanently.
    - Once committed, changes cannot be undone.
    - Used when you are confident that the changes should be applied to the database.
- **`ROLLBACK`**:
    
    - Reverts all changes made during the transaction.
    - Undoes all modifications and restores the database to the state it was in before the transaction started.
    - Used when an error occurs or when you want to discard changes made during a transaction.
## Transaction
A **transaction** in the context of databases is a sequence of one or more operations (such as insert, update, delete, or select) that are executed as a single unit of work. The key property of a transaction is that it must be **atomic**, meaning either all operations within the transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are applied.
