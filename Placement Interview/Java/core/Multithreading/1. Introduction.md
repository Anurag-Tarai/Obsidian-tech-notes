##### What is Instruction ?
- A single operation in a program, executed by the CPU.
- **Example**: `ADD A, B` (adds two values).
##### What is Code ?
A set of written instructions in a programming language.
##### What is Program ?
A set of instructions designed to complete a specific task.
##### What is a process ?
- A process is an **instance of a program in execution**.
- It contains the program code, its current activity, and the resources it needs to execute, such as CPU, memory, files, and I/O devices.
##### What is a thread ?
- The smallest unit of execution within a process. 
- It allows a program to perform multiple tasks concurrently.
- In Java, methods are typically executed sequentially, but threads allow methods to execute concurrently.
### **Key Features**

1. **Lightweight**: Shares memory and resources with other threads in the same process.
2. **Independent Execution**: Each thread runs a separate task.
3. **Faster Communication**: Threads in the same process communicate more efficiently than processes.
