### **Thread Priority in Java**

Thread priority in Java is a way to influence the order in which threads are scheduled for execution by the operating system's thread scheduler. Java provides three constants to represent thread priorities:

- **`Thread.MIN_PRIORITY`**: The lowest priority (1).
- **`Thread.NORM_PRIORITY`**: The default priority (5).
- **`Thread.MAX_PRIORITY`**: The highest priority (10).

### **Key Points:**

1. **Setting Priority**: Thread priority can be set using the `setPriority(int priority)` method, where the priority is an integer value between 1 and 10.
2. **Thread Scheduling**: Higher-priority threads are generally given preference by the thread scheduler, but this is not guaranteed, as thread scheduling depends on the operating system.
3. **Thread Behavior**:
    - **Higher priority** threads are likely to run before **lower priority** threads, but the exact behavior depends on the system's thread scheduler.
    - Thread priorities are **hints** to the operating system, not strict rules.
4. **Default Priority**: By default, all threads have a priority of **5 (NORM_PRIORITY)**.

### **Usage Example**:
```java
Thread t = new Thread();
t.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);  // Set highest priority
t.start();

```
### **Important Considerations**:

- Thread priorities are more effective in **real-time systems**.
- In general-purpose operating systems, thread priority might not always affect execution order due to the OS's own scheduling policies.
- **Starvation**: Low-priority threads might not get CPU time if high-priority threads keep executing.
