- **Concurrency**: Managing multiple tasks at once, but not necessarily simultaneously. Tasks are interleaved on a single processor (e.g., multitasking in a single-core CPU).
    
- **Parallelism**: Executing multiple tasks simultaneously, typically on multiple processors or cores, for faster execution.
