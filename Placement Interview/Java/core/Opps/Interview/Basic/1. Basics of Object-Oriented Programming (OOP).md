1. **OOPS**
   - `What is Object-Oriented Programming?`
	 - **Object-Oriented Programming**Â is a methodology or paradigm to design/write a program or software using classes and objects.
   - `How it differs from other paradigms.`
	- **Procedural Programming:** Organizes code into functions or procedures (e.g., **C**, **Pascal**).
	
	- **Functional Programming:** Focuses on immutability and pure functions (e.g., **Haskell**, **Scala**).

	- **Declarative Programming:** Describes what to do, not how (e.g., **SQL**, **HTML**).
		
2. **[[Benefits of OOP]]**
	- `Re-usability`: Reuse existing code.
	- `Modularity`: Code is divided into independent objects or classes, making it easier to manage, maintain, and scale.
	- [[Scalability]]: Adapt systems as needs grow.
	- `Maintainability`: Organize code for easy updates.

3. **[[Procedural Programming vs. Object-Oriented Programming]]**
	- `Procedural`: Organizes code into functions or procedures that operate on data. 
	- `OOP`: Organizes code into objects and classes, where each object represents a real-world entity with attributes (data) and methods (behavior).

4. **Key Principles of OOP or Four Pillar of OOP**
   - `Abstraction`: Hiding complex details, showing only the necessary parts.
   - `Encapsulation`: Binding data and method into single unit, here is object.
   - `Inheritance`: Child class inherits properties and behavior from parent class, promoting reusability and modularity.
   - `Polymorphism` : Having many forms. There are two types - compile time and run time 
Why Polymorphism : We need **polymorphism** because it allows us to write flexible, reusable, and easily maintainable code by enabling the same method, function, or operator to behave differently in different contexts.
