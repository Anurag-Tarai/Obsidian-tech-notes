## String Mistake 1 
### First Implementation (Correct):

`if(!(Character.isLetter(c) || Character.isDigit(c) || c=='_')) return "false";`

- The condition checks if the character is **not** a letter, digit, or underscore (`_`).
- The `||` operator ensures that the condition evaluates as **true** if the character meets **any** of the valid criteria.
- If the character does not satisfy any of these conditions, the `if` block is executed, returning `"false"`.

### Second Implementation (Incorrect):

java

Copy code

`if(!Character.isLetter(c) || !Character.isDigit(c) || c!='_') return "false";`

- The `!` negates each individual check.
- The condition becomes problematic because of the **`||`** operator:
    - For any character, at least one of the negated conditions will always evaluate to **true**.
        - For example:
            - For `'A'`: `!Character.isLetter('A')` is **false**, but `!Character.isDigit('A')` is **true**.
            - For `'1'`: `!Character.isLetter('1')` is **true**, and `c != '_'` is **true**.
            - For `'_'`: `c != '_'` is **false**, but `!Character.isLetter('_')` is **true`.
    - Since `||` is used, **one true condition makes the whole statement true**, which incorrectly triggers the return `"false"`.
