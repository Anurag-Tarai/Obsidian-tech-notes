### ADT (Abstract Data Type)
An **abstract data type (ADT)** is a way to describe a data structure by defining its behavior, not how it's implemented. It specifies what operations can be performed on the data and what results are expected, without focusing on the details of how these operations are carried out.

For example, a **Stack** is an ADT with operations like:

- **push** (add an item)
- **pop** (remove an item)
- **peek** (view the top item)
- **isEmpty** (check if the stack is empty)

The **Stack ADT** tells us what operations we can perform but doesn't say whether the data will be stored in an array, linked list, or another structure. The focus is on the functionality, not the implementation.

Examples : **Stack**, **Queue**, **List**, **Set**, **Map (Dictionary)**, **Graph**, **Tree**, **Heap**, **Priority Queue**.
