ArrayÂ is a collection of data of the same type that are stored at contiguous memory locations.

- Fixed sized, once allocate can't change.
- Arrays store data in contiguous memory locations, which makes deletion and insertion very difficult to implement.
- Searching is time taking- have to traverse.
