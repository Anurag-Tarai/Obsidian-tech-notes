### what is Data ?
**Data** is raw, unprocessed facts or figures without context (e.g., "50," "apple," "true").
### What is Information ?
**Information** is processed, organized, or structured data that has meaning and is useful (e.g., "50 apples were sold today").
### What is Data structure ?
**Data Structure** is a way of organizing, storing, and managing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently for operations like retrieval, modification, and processing.
E.g. - Array, ArrayList, LinkedList
### Why are strings or primitive types not data structures?
Primitive types like `int`, `char`, or `float` store single values and lack structure for managing multiple values

Strings are immutable sequences of characters, treated as single data types, not structures.
### What is Algorithm ?
**Algorithm**: A step-by-step set of instructions or rules designed to solve a specific problem or perform a task in a finite amount of time.

### What is the need of DSA ?
**Optimize Performance**: Build applications that run faster and use fewer resources.

**Efficient Data Handling**: Manage and process data effectively in real-time.

 **Solve Complex Problems**: Implement features like search, sort, and routing. 
 
 **Enhance Scalability**: Support high data volumes and user loads smoothly.
